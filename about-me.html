        <h2>Hi! I'm Sue ... </h2>
        <p>I am an Australian born Chinese. My parents migrated to Perth, Western Australia from Hong Kong in the late 70’s. Lived my life mainly in Perth except for the gap year after university where I traveled to South Korea to teach English. This had nothing to do with K-Pop at all!  …So really, I was ahead of my times.</p>
        <p>Prior to my overseas arrangement, I completed a Double Diploma in Business Administration & Accounting at TAFE, before furthering my studies at Curtin University where I completed a Double Degree with a Bachelor in Arts & Tourism Management. </p>
        <p>Returning from my gap year I settled back in Perth & have been here since, working in various roles in Administration, Retail & Corporate Travel, and the last 15 years within the Banking Industry in a Personal Assistant Role. </p>
        <p>Fast forward to today & as much as I love what I do in my role, I’m ready to take the leap into the tech industry.</p>
        <p>I’ve always been a bit of an introverted techy at heart! I love most things to do with computers & in fact my tech journey started with my first PC, the 1984 Apple Macintosh Classic (yes the one that Steve Jobs has on his biography!) I still have this today, boxed away in its original Styrofoam box a& still working… I just haven’t had time to unbox and load up Prince or Persia !! </p>
